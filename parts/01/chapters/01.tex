\DndDropCapLine{T}{his package is designed to aid you in} writing beautifully typeset documents for the fifth edition of the world's greatest roleplaying game. It starts by adjusting the section formatting from the defaults in \LaTeX{} to something a bit more familiar to the reader. The chapter formatting is displayed above.

\section{Section}
Sections break up chapters into large groups of associated text.

\subsection{Subsection}
Subsections further break down the information for the reader.

\subsubsection{Subsubsection}
Sub subsections are the furthest division of text that still have a block header. Below this level, headers are displayed inline.

\paragraph{Paragraph}
The paragraph format is seldom used in the core books, but is available if you prefer it to the ``normal'' style.

\subparagraph{Subparagraph}
The subparagraph format with the paragraph indent is likely going to be more familiar to the reader.

\section{Special Sections}
The module also includes functions to aid in the proper typesetting of multi-line section headers: |\DndFeatHeader| for feats, |\DndItemHeader| magic items and traps, and |\DndSpellHeader| for spells.
